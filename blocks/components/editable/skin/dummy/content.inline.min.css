/* 
This is a dummy file. 
The real TinyMCE skin will be included on the page directly before the editor 
is loaded.
Ideally TinyMCE should allow us to skip loading the skin by setting the skin 
(or skin_url) to false but the current implementation does not do that and
instead loads the default skin if we do not specify a URL.
